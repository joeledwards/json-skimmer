# json-skimmer

`json-skimmer` is an incremental, event-driven JSON parser designed for
long-lived streams. It discovers top-level objects and arrays, reports malformed
candidates, and can continue scanning for later JSON instead of terminating.

The crate is in early development. Its core parser is dependency-free and does
not buffer complete documents.
